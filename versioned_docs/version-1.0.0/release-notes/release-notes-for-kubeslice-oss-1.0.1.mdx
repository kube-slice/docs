# Release Notes for KubeSlice OSS 1.0.1

*Release date: 13th Jul 2023*

KubeSlice is a ***cloud-independent*** platform that combines network, application, Kubernetes, and deployment services 
in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster and multi-tenant environment. KubeSlice achieves this 
by creating logical application ***slice*** boundaries that enable seamless communication between pods and services across 
clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers.

We continue to add new features and enhancements to KubeSlice. 

## What's New
These release notes describe the new changes and enhancements in this version.

## Limitations
We cannot have an application namespace placed in the Kubernetes Pod Security Standard (PSS) restricted profile.

## Issues Fixed
- KubeSlice is interoperable with the Kubernetes PSS-defined profiles: baseline and privileged. These profiles could be 
  applied to an application namespace that is part of a multi-cluster slice created using KubeSlice. To be fully operational, 
  KubeSlice requires certain privileges that are allowed in the baseline and privileged profiles, but not in the restricted 
  profile. Hence, an application namespace should not be placed in the restricted profile if it 
  needs to be connected to a slice.
- We have fixed the issue where the external gateway went missing when the namespace isolation was enabled on the 
  KubeSlice Manager.
