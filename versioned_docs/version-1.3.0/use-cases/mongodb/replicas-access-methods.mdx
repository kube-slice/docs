# Replicas Access Methods

Once the MongoDB replica sets are deployed over the slice across multiple clusters, there are different deployment models 
that can be used to access the replicas.

Access replicas from within the clusters
In this deployment model, services deployed in different namespaces within the same slice can access any of the replica sets for 
read and write to the primary replica set.

DR failover: When the primary replica set fails over to a secondary replica set, the services can connect to the new primary and 
continue to write to the primary.

Access replica sets from outside the cluster
In this deployment model, MongoDB replicas will be offered as a service to external clients. The replica sets - primary and 
secondary - are accessed from clients via MongoDB service access points.

MongoDB replica set services will be exposed via LB service in each cluster with each replica set with its own FQDN. MongoDB 
clients can use the connection string to query the replica sets to determine the primary/secondary status of the replica sets 
and connect to primary for writes and reads for any of the replicas. With appropriate global DNS LB policies the read requests 
can connect to low-latency or geolocation based read replica set endpoints.
